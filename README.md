**E-commerce Customer Segmentation**

Overview

The E-commerce Customer Segmentation project aims to analyze and categorize customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behaviors and demographic attributes. This segmentation enables personalized marketing strategies, enhances customer engagement, and drives business growth through targeted campaigns.

**Key Features**

**Data Collection and Preparation:**

Collect customer data including transaction histories, demographic information, and website interactions.
Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Perform EDA to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.
Visualize key metrics such as purchase frequency, average order value, and customer lifetime value.

**Feature Engineering:**

Create new features such as Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value (RFM) to capture customer behavior.
Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features for modeling.

**Clustering Algorithms:**

Apply K-means clustering to group customers into segments based on similarities in their purchasing patterns.
Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method or silhouette analysis.

**Customer Profiling:**

Analyze each segment's characteristics to create detailed customer profiles.
Identify high-value customers, frequent shoppers, and other key segments.
**
Implementation and Deployment:**

Integrate customer segments into the e-commerce platform for real-time application.
Develop targeted marketing strategies and personalized recommendations based on segmented customer profiles.
